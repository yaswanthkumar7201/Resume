        I started my journey with Independence Australia as an Intern. While my intern, I have exposer on various tools. I have gained some real-time experience in WordPress and managing content in WordPress websites (CMS) and learned how to optimize (SEO) and Smaply is another tool where we develop customer journey and road map, on how to overcome the pain journey of our customers while using our website. 

I have worked on a small project called Hackathon where my work is to develop a WordPress website for health professionals based upon the Persona and Customer journey. And ABtasty is another tool which is used for managing content and keep track of data in website and creating popups. This tool has number of features that helps to easily change content or create new content in our website without any coding. And worked with PWA and One Signal.
